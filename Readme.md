PokeBattle is a game that will let the user get a pokemon and enter a battle with another pokemon trainer which itself will have its own pokemon. 
On top of being able to get a pokemon, the user will also be able to get a heal potion which they will be able to use in battle to heal their pokemon.
In order to keep track of the user's wins and losses, the user will have to login and authenticate with their user account.
